# 🛒 E-Commerce Project (Vanilla JavaScript)

Welcome to my E-Commerce project!  
This project is built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries.

As a learner, my goal with this project was to explore and implement **advanced JavaScript concepts** while simulating the core functionality of a simple online store.
